# Complete data for torsion pendulum magnetometer 
This repository contains everything needed to understand what my students and I have done in our torsion pendulum magnetometer experiment. Within you'll find Jupyter Notebooks for analysis, raw data (calibrations, time series data, etc) as well as simulations, experimental control code, and Latex Code for any publications.
